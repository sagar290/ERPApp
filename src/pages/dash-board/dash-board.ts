Even if usage has increased the metric of comparing growth to a competitorâ€™s success might illuminate a weakness.Experience tells me that this underperformance and market weakness is usually a result of insignificant meaning. For some reason, the brand is not resonating as strongly as it should and as a result the market performance is less than expected.Relaunching a brand is similar to rebranding. But rebranding has some built in bias in its very language. It turns out to be very similar in scope but it SOUNDS more drastic.It actually is not drastic. Point-in-fact  rebranding requires a relaunch and a brand relaunch requires some elements of rebranding.In our experience a weakness in brand meaning is often brought to a head through market research. Here are some of the signs that a brand relaunch is well overdue ana brand intervention is needed',

Often they return a variety of meanings if the brand has any resonance to them at all. In other words, prospects are confused about the brand&rsquo;s promise and its valued position in their lives.</li><li>The research has uncovered a brand meaning that is highly emotional and resonant with the target audience but is not the meaning you claim. If this value position is not CLAIMED by any competitor in the category, it might be a smart move to reposition the brand to own that valuable space. When&nbsp;the brand meaning returned in the research reflects an erroneous value mentioned in point 1, you need to think about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stealingshare.com/2016/01/12/electrolux-as-a-modern-idea/">brand repair</a>. If the brand returns a variety of values and none of them are negative or contrary to the new position a brand relaunch without brand repair may be in order.</li><li>If the research indicates that the market scape has significantly changed and while still valuable, the new opportunity is of higher emotional intensity than the old one, a change would be indicated.</li><li>A new competitor has entered the category and has reshaped the market scape into one that is particularly advantageous to their brand and places your legacy brand in a disadvantageous position. If true, you might want to consider a brand relaunch as well. No brand, regardless of it position in the category, can afford to ignore a sea change in the category for long. Remaining stationary while a new competitor reshapes opinions and preferences is a recipe for marketing disaster. The sooner your brand responds the better.</li></ul>',

When the new position is powerfully identified there will be a sense of risk in ignoring it. I&rsquo;m not talking about a new position that threatens the prospect, but think for a moment what it means to have a position that represents the highest emotional intensity in the category?
